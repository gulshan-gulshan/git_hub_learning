<!-- practising git commands

 if i want this folder to be on github then i have to use gitinit (it means git initilization)

 u = means untract file

 if i want to make it tracked then i have run this command --> git add 

 after adding this (git add) your U will change into A

 by default git makes some branches

 by typing (git brach) i got nothing  , in order for it to show that  we have to create a stage , first it will save it in a folder then i have to push it in the github in order it to do that have to use code named git commit -m (m is for message)

 after doing this i will make a branch

 after this i will make a brach by writing the code --> git brach -M main

 git remote -v (where is origin and destinaition)

 now i will try to make a file but we dont want to 

after --> -->
